# Phishing Classifier: Detect Fraudulent Websites Using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Overview

The **Phishing Classifier** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to detect **phishing websites** and protect users from **financial and personal data loss**. By analyzing various website features, the model can intelligently predict whether a site is **legitimate (1)** or **malicious (-1)**.

Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, often leading to identity theft and fraud. This project aims to **automate the detection process using ML algorithms**, providing fast and reliable predictions that can be integrated into real-world web filters, browsers, or security tools.

## 🧪 Machine Learning Workflow

### ✅ Training Pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Fetches data from MongoDB Atlas → stores in `artifacts/raw.csv`
2. **Data Validation**: Checks schema, nulls, column match, etc.
3. **Data Transformation**: Train-test split, encoding
4. **Model Training**: Trains using:

   * XGBoost ✅
   * Logistic Regression
   * Naive Bayes
5. **Model Evaluation**: Saves `model.pkl` with accuracy logging
6. **Model Export**: Uploads final model to AWS S3

### 🔄 Prediction Pipeline:

* Accepts test input via Flask POST request
* Downloads `model.pkl` from S3
* Predicts and returns phishing/safe classification

### 🔥 Accuracy:

* Achieved up to **99% accuracy** with XGBoost

## 🌐 Deployment

* ✅ Dockerized using custom `Dockerfile`
* ✅ Deployed to Render as a Web Service
* ✅ Auto-starts Flask app on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
* 🌐 Public access via Render-generated URL

## 🧠 HLD (High Level Design)

```plaintext
User → HTML UI → Flask API → Predict Pipeline
                       ↑
             Model (S3) ← Model Trainer ← Data Pipeline ← MongoDB
```

## 🔍 LLD (Low Level Design)

* `MongoDBClient`: Connects and reads datasets
* `DataIngestion`: Pulls data and saves locally
* `DataValidation`: Schema matching, null checks
* `DataTransformation`: Preprocessing and splits
* `ModelTrainer`: Trains multiple models, selects best
* `PredictPipeline`: Loads model and predicts on input
* `AWSUploader`: Uploads model to S3

## ✅ Conclusion

Phishing attacks are a growing cybersecurity threat.
Cybercriminals use deceptive websites to steal sensitive information.
Traditional blacklist-based methods fail to detect new phishing attacks effectively.

Machine Learning provides an efficient solution.
By analyzing various features (URL-based, domain-based, and content-based), we can classify websites as phishing or legitimate.
Our trained model helps in automating phishing detection and improving security.

Results show that ML models can detect phishing websites with high accuracy.
Random Forest and XGBoost performed well.
Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicate model reliability.

## 🚀 Future Improvement
🔹 1. Real-time Phishing Detection
Currently, the model works on pre-collected datasets.
Future versions can integrate live URL scanning to detect phishing websites in real-time.
Implementation: Use API-based lookups for website verification.

🔹 2. Deep Learning for Enhanced Accuracy
Neural networks (LSTMs, CNNs) can be used for phishing detection based on URL patterns and webpage content.
Why? Deep learning can capture hidden patterns better than traditional ML models.

🔹 3. Browser Extension for Phishing Prevention
Develop a Google Chrome or Firefox extension that warns users when they visit a phishing site.
The extension can interact with the ML model via an API to analyze URLs dynamically.

🔹 4. Expanding Features for Better Detection
Add Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze webpage text for phishing indicators.
Example: Many phishing pages contain urgent language like “Your account will be blocked soon! Click here now!”

🔹 5. Integration with Cybersecurity Systems
Collaborate with email security solutions to flag phishing links in emails.
Build an AI-powered firewall that blocks phishing domains automatically.

🔹 6. Improving Dataset Quality
Collect real-world phishing websites and continuously update the dataset.
Implement web scrapers to gather fresh phishing examples from cybersecurity sources.
