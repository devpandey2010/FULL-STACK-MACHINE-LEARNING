# Phishing Classifier: Detect Fraudulent Websites Using Machine Learning

## üöÄ Overview

The **Phishing Classifier** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to detect **phishing websites** and protect users from **financial and personal data loss**. By analyzing various website features, the model can intelligently predict whether a site is **legitimate (1)** or **malicious (-1)**.

Phishing attacks are a major cybersecurity threat, often leading to identity theft and fraud. This project aims to **automate the detection process using ML algorithms**, providing fast and reliable predictions that can be integrated into real-world web filters, browsers, or security tools.

## üß™ Machine Learning Workflow

### ‚úÖ Training Pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Fetches data from MongoDB Atlas ‚Üí stores in `artifacts/raw.csv`
2. **Data Validation**: Checks schema, nulls, column match, etc.
3. **Data Transformation**: Train-test split, encoding
4. **Model Training**: Trains using:

   * XGBoost ‚úÖ
   * Logistic Regression
   * Naive Bayes
5. **Model Evaluation**: Saves `model.pkl` with accuracy logging
6. **Model Export**: Uploads final model to AWS S3

### üîÑ Prediction Pipeline:

* Accepts test input via Flask POST request
* Downloads `model.pkl` from S3
* Predicts and returns phishing/safe classification

### üî• Accuracy:

* Achieved up to **99% accuracy** with XGBoost

---

## üåê Deployment

* ‚úÖ Dockerized using custom `Dockerfile`
* ‚úÖ Deployed to Render as a Web Service
* ‚úÖ Auto-starts Flask app on `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
* üåê Public access via Render-generated URL

---

## üìä Visuals (Optional: Add Images to GitHub)

* EDA Visualizations
* HTML Frontend Screenshot
* Prediction Results
